🚀 Automated Software Testing Framework for Embedded Systems

📌 Overview

This project focuses on automating the software testing process for automotive embedded systems, including heating systems, roof windows, and convertible roof controls. The framework is built using Python, pytest, and GitHub Actions to enable continuous integration, automated testing, and reporting.

🛠️ Features

✅ Automated Test Execution using pytest

✅ CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions

✅ Detailed Test Reports generated using pytest-html

✅ Hardware-Free Software Validation

✅ Continuous Testing & Reporting for improved efficiency

🚀 Setup & Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run Tests Manually
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html

🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
This project uses GitHub Actions to automate testing on every code push. The workflow:
   1 Runs pytest automatically.
   2 Generates a test report (report.html).
   3 Uploads the report as an artifact in GitHub Actions.

Running Tests in CI/CD
Push changes to GitHub, and tests will run automatically.
git add .
git commit -m "Added new test cases"
git push origin main

Check the GitHub Actions tab for the test report.
📊 Viewing Test Reports
Run tests manually → Open report.html in a browser.
From GitHub Actions → Download the test report from the workflow run.

🚀 Future Enhancements
📧 Email Notifications for test results.
📈 Performance Testing for embedded system modules.
🔗 Integration with Jenkins for enterprise-level CI/CD.
